HTML and CSS Refactor

This project required "cleaning up" existing code for the purpose of making it more efficient and organized.


The format of the HTML and CSS were reorganized.
    - comments added
    - indentation added to help better read the code
    - classes and id's were added and removed
    - navigation bar taken out of the body and put into a header
    - separated body into two sections (main content and sidebar)
    - footer was taken out of the body and put into a footer section
    

## User Story

AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines


## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
